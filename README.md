## Learning Points
    This project was an oppurtunity to learn how to use server side API's, in the future I would siimplify my fetch functions by calling functions inside of it. Instead of
    what I did and which is making one very long function that does everything. I feel doing it by calling on functions improves readability and that is why for future
    cases I would consider doing that instead.
---
## Problems faced
During this problem I switched back to using normal javascript as opposed to jquery to be sure I was comfortable with both, in doing so i found 
myself mixing the languages causing some errors. I also found myself wanting to use alot of Jquery's built in commands which were more of a convienence over 
normal Javascript, which did force me to think a little deeper into how to complete those actions.
